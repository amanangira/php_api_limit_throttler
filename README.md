# php_api_limit_throttler
This is a simple php based api rate limiter. I wrote this once for small assignment. It uses redis for fast memory access to authentication token. And does not a secure encryption system. JWT is a good implementation for it, which I plan to add on myself. Ofcourse, it has large scope of improvements for which I invite you to fix :)
